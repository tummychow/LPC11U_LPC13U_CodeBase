Waiting on some male-female jumper wires. (Paid on the tenth, seller has not shipped yet...) The LPCXpresso covers the width of my breadboard, leaving no room for the male-male wires I already have. Luckily, the headers I soldered onto the board were [double-ended](http://adafru.it/400), so I can attach female headers onto the top. Once the jumper wires show up, I can begin testing that [ILI9325 driver](http://github.com/tummychow/arm-alarm/commit/955f78960a4a321a8060a03dae2e6d94c56e4587).
