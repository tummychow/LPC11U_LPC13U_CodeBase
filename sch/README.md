# Schematic README
Alright, schematic time! I have two schematics but only one is good enough to contemplate manufacture right now, because it's really simple. The other will wait until it's ready.

All schematics are in Eagle 6.5.0. I include all the Eagle files (schematics, board layouts, libraries needed to view them), but I also include Gerbers and exported images in case you don't use Eagle and want to manufacture the board, or just want to see what my work looks like.

The first schematic is the [PSU](http://github.com/tummychow/arm-alarm/blob/arm-alarm/sch/psu.md) which I'm going to use for my project, but I've broken it into an individual board first. The other schematic is for the whole board. I'm not going to put that up until it's in sensible condition and ready to be tested.

## License
I don't really like thinking about licensing too much since it distracts me from the actual design, which I find a lot more fun/relevant/interesting. I have read about some of the differences between open source hardware and software and why they require different licensing schemes. Details about copyrights vs patents, but IANAL so it's not clear to me in the slightest. If you're reading this and know of a helpful link, open an issue about my license choice to let me know!

Anyway, for now, and since I'm not interested in a copyleft license, I'll save myself the confusion and license the schematics/layouts/associated content under the same [BSD 3-clause license](http://github.com/tummychow/arm-alarm/blob/arm-alarm/License.txt) as my code.
