**ARM ALARM** is a project to create a better alarm clock. This is the project development blog. If you're desperately interested in my progress, you've come to the right place.

For technical and design details, check out the [readme](http://github.com/tummychow/arm-alarm/blob/arm-alarm/README.md). In brief: ARM ALARM is an alarm clock based on the [NXP LPC1347 microcontroller](http://www.nxp.com/pip/LPC1347FBD48.html) and a [2.8" graphic TFT LCD](http://adafru.it/376) with a touchscreen. It aims to solve the interface problems of classical alarm clocks and the hardware problems (read: low volume) of smartphone-based alarm clocks with one custom solution.

ARM ALARM is developed by Stephen Jung, using an extensive [codebase](http://github.com/microbuilder/LPC11U_LPC13U_CodeBase) maintained primarily by [microbuilder.eu](http://github.com/microbuilder). This blog is based on [Lanyon](http://github.com/poole/lanyon) by [Mark Otto](http://github.com/mdo).
